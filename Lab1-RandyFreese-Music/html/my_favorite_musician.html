        One of my favorite music groups is The Roots. They are a hip hop group
        that was formed in 1987 by Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter and Ahmir
        "Questlove" Thompson. The Roots are known for their jazzy and eclectic
        approach to hip hop featuring live musical instruments. They are also
        the house band for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.

                <p>
                    The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson and Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter while they were both attending the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts.[8] They would busk out on the street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Black Thought rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roots#cite_note-9">[9]</a>
